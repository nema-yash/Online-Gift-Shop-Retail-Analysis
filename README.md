The Business Challenge:
1) **Performance Overview**: How has the online retailer performed over 2 years after transitioning from offline to online medium?
2) **Purchase Behavior**: Who are the online customers responsible for driving sales for the retailer and what drives product purchases?
3) **Deep Dive Product Purchase Behavior and Key Audiences**: Which products tend to get purchased together, and which audience segments should the retailer target? How does demand for these products work?

Based on our analysis, we would like to recommend strategies the online retailer can adopt to improve sales.
